Snapdex is a production-quality **Pok√©dex-style app** built with Swift and SwiftUI. Users can snap pictures of Pok√©mon merchandise found in the wild (plushes, trading cards, etc.) to complete their own Pok√©dex, thanks to AI-powered recognition using **TensorFlow Lite** and **OpenAI**. This project serves as both a **learning experience** and a **professional showcase** of modern iOS app development.
